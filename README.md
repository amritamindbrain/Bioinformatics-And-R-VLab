# Bioinformatics-And-R-VLab
 Bioinformatics and Data Science in Biotechnology Lab In this lab, students will be able to learn and practice basics of R programming. Students can expand their skillset in R programming by reading and writing biological sequence data in R platform. Educating this will allow users to learn how to use R as an open source language for learning bioinformatics data processing. Specifically, this lab will help analyse biological sequence data using simple R code snippets. With the features such as flexibility, data handling and modelling capabilitie R programming has been a widely accepted software tools for bioinformatics. It also supports the creation and use of self-describing data structures. With the trends in data science, the lab focuses on FOSS implementations which can be further utilized as laboratory manual or reference material for life science students.
