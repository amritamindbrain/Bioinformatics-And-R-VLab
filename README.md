# Bioinformatics-and-R
 Bioinformatics and Data Science in Biotechnology Lab In this lab, students will be able to learn and practice basics of R programming. Students can expand their skillset in R programming by reading and writing biological sequence data in R platform. Educating this will allow users to learn how to use R as an open source language for learning bioinformatics data processing. Specifically, this lab will help analyse biological sequence data using simple R code snippets. With the features such as flexibility, data handling and modelling capabilitie R programming has been a widely accepted software tools for bioinformatics. It also supports the creation and use of self-describing data structures. With the trends in data science, the lab focuses on FOSS implementations which can be further utilized as laboratory manual or reference material for life science students.


# About

The simulation is a web-based application that allows to click and execute directly from a browser (web-based simulation platform).
The application is very light, does not require any installation other than a modern browser.
# Installation
Installation process is really simple:

  - Clone the latest version of the Web Application.
  - Unpack archive and open file `<experiment_name>/index.html` in your browser.
